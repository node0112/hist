            <div class="text"> A World Heritage Site is a landmark or area with legal protection by an international convention administered by the UNESCO Organization. World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity.</div>

            <h1 class="title">Why Are Some Sites Selected As World Heritage Sites?</h1>
            <li class="text">To be selected, a World Heritage Site must be a somehow unique landmark which is geographically and historically identifiable and has special cultural or physical significance. For example, World Heritage Sites might be ancient ruins or historical structures, buildings, cities, deserts, forests, islands, lakes, monuments, mountains, or wilderness areas. A World Heritage Site may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet, or it might be a place of great natural beauty.</li>

            <li class="text">These sites also provide life-supporting benefits to millions of people – 90% of sites provide jobs, two-thirds are crucial sources of water and about half help prevent natural disasters such as floods or landslides.</li>

                    Almost every country has signed the World Heritage Convention, committing to the best level of protection for these sites. Yet natural World Heritage sites are under increasing pressure. Climate change is the fastest growing threat to natural World Heritage, with the number of sites highly threatened by climate change almost doubling in the three years between 2014 and 2017. <br />                   
                    <br />Here's what can be done to save them:
                    <li>To protect the world’s natural World Heritage sites from growing threats, investing in their protection and management is key. This is a collective responsibility shared by governments, civil society, local communities and indigenous peoples. </li>
                    <li>Area-based conservation – can ensure natural World Heritage sites enjoy internationally benchmarked protection and management.</li>
